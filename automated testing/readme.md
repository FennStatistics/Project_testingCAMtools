# Automated testing using Selenium (Python)

Automated testing is a software testing technique that involves using tools and scripts to execute test cases automatically. It helps ensure the quality and reliability of software by verifying that it functions correctly under different scenarios. [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) is a popular open-source framework for automating web browsers, and it provides a Python library that allows you to write automated tests.

## Get started 

To get started with Selenium in Python, you need to install the Selenium library using pip, which is the package installer for Python. You can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install Selenium:

Additionally, you will need to download the appropriate web driver for the browser you want to automate (e.g., Chrome, Firefox). The web driver acts as a bridge between Selenium and the browser. Make sure to place the web driver executable in a location that is included in your system's PATH environment variable.

## Writing tests

 Writing Test Cases with Selenium Once you have set up Selenium, you can start writing test cases using Python. Selenium provides a rich set of methods and functions to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and perform assertions. You can locate elements on a web page using various strategies such as ID, class name, CSS selector, or XPath. Then, you can perform actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, or navigating through pages.

## Running and Analyzing Test Results

After writing your test cases, you can execute them using a test runner or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code. Selenium will open the specified browser, navigate to the desired web page, and perform the actions defined in your test cases. You can also add assertions to verify that the expected behavior is met. Test runners provide detailed reports and logs that help you analyze the test results, identify failures, and debug any issues.
